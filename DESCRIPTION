Description: Provides a drop-in replacement for rasterize() from the 'raster'
   package that takes 'sf'-type objects, and is much faster. There is support
   for the main options provided by the rasterize() function, including
   setting the field used and background value, and options for 
   aggregating multi-layer rasters. Uses the scan line algorithm attributed to
   Wylie et al. (1967) <doi:10.1145/1465611.1465619>.
